        bool "Enable the eLog component"

            This enables the eLog component.

    config ESP_ELOG_BUFFER_SIZE
        int "Ring buffer size"
        depends on ESP_ELOG_ENABLED
        default 512
        help
        Size of the log storage circular buffer, must be a power of 2

    config ESP_ELOG_DELETE_OLD_LOG_IF_FULL
        bool "Delete old logs when full"
        depends on ESP_ELOG_ENABLED
        default y
        help
        Define the strategy to use when the buffer is full.
        By default, it deletes the oldest logs (like a FIFO), but that takes more binary size than doing nothing (in that case it can't store more logs)

    config ESP_ELOG_SIZE_TYPE
        string "The type to use to store the log size. Can be empty for no storage, see help"
        depends on ESP_ELOG_ENABLED
        default "uint8"
        help
        By default, the log header doesn't contain the stored size for the log and its arguments. This saves memory in the buffer, but when
        deleting logs, it means parsing the log format line to skip the arguments to find the next log position (so it has a cost in binary code size and runtime performance).
        If defined to a unsigned type, it will store the size for the log and its arguments after the header allowing to skip the format line parsing (binary code and performance saving)
        at the cost of the given type storage in memory.

    config ESP_ELOG_ERROR_TYPE
        bool "Throw exception upon error"
        depends on ESP_ELOG_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        Define the error strategy when a log can't be saved in the log buffer.
        By default, it calls a function in Log namespace with signature "void errorStoringArgumentsFor(const char* format)" is called
        If set to y, an exception Log::Exception(const char* format) is thrown instead

    config ESP_ELOG_PERSISTENT_LOG
        bool "Enable sleep persistant log storage"
        depends on ESP_ELOG_ENABLED
        default y
        help
        If set, the log buffer is stored in the RTC memory (which is usually small). This memory can be kept powered on while sleeping so the buffer isn't cleared when waking up.
        This can be useful to avoid loosing logs for sleepy device but it consumes precious RTC memory space.
